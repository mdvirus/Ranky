<u>**FAQs:**</u>
1. What is Ranky?
    - Ranky is a python program for making rankings of competitive programmers by their total problem solve count on our listed OJ's.
2. Why Ranky?
    - Often times, a group of competitive programmers practices on different OJ's. The group members wants to know the position of them (among the group members). Or a mentor of them wants to know about their progress. That's why you can use Ranky as a ranking shower or a statics shower.
3. How to use it?
    - Download and install _Python v3.X.X_ on your device (if needed).
    - Install _requests_ and _flask_ module (By using `pip install requests` and `pip install flask` command). 
    - Change the user _data_ list in the following format. Then run it. Our program will show you the statics of the users.
```python
data = [ [0, "Name_to_be_shown", "username1", "TophOJ_profile_link", "DimikOJ_profile_link", "URI-OJ_profile_link"], [...], [...], ... ]
```
4. Why just 3 OJ's?
    - Currently this program supports 3 OJ's. Toph, DimikOJ and URI. But you are welcome to add custom OJ's too.
5. I just love it. Can I contribute?
    - Of course you can contribute. Just fork the repository. Customize the program. And make a pull request. We'll review the pull request and merge it if possible.
